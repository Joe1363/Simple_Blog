A simple blog-type site for educational purposes.

Created for practice using HAML and the CanCan gem.

The application sets permissions to four different kinds of users: guests(users not logged in), authors (users that are logged in), moderators, and admin.

The application only lets guests read articles and see an authors user page for a list of that author's articles. Authors can create, edit, and destroy articles in addition to viewing. Moderators are able delete any article in addition to what a author can do. An admin can assign the position of moderator to a user in addition to everything a moderator and author can do. Moderators and the admin cannot edit an authors article, only delete it.

Run rake db:seed for a sample database.
